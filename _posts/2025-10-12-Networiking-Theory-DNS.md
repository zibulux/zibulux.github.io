## 🧾 Introduction to DNS

Every time you visit a website, your computer needs to know **where that site lives on the Internet**.  
Instead of remembering numbers like `172.217.160.142`, you type friendly names like `google.com`. DNS (Domain Name System) is the **phonebook of the Internet** — it converts domain names into IP addresses so devices can communicate.

> 💡 Think of DNS like your smartphone contacts: you type “Mom,” and your phone knows her number. DNS works the same way — you type `google.com`, and it finds the right IP address behind it.

## ⚙️ DNS Components (quick recap)

- **Forwarders**: DNS servers that forward queries to other resolvers (e.g., ISP or public DNS).  
- **Zones**: Administrative sections of DNS (forward lookup: name → IP, reverse lookup: IP → name).  
- **Records**:
  - `A` → Domain → IPv4
  - `AAAA` → Domain → IPv6
  - `CNAME` → Canonical name / alias
  - `MX` → Mail exchanger
  - `TXT` → Arbitrary text (used for SPF, verification, etc.)
  - `SOA` → Start of Authority (zone metadata + TTL)
  - `NS` → Nameserver delegation
  - `SRV` → Service records (e.g., _sip._tcp)

## 🔄 How DNS Works — Step by Step

<img src="/assets/img/networking/DNS-Schema.png" alt="DNS hierarchy diagram" />

When you type a domain in your browser, DNS translates it into an IP address in a few steps:

1. **Browser / Stub Resolver (Your device)**  
   - Your browser asks the OS resolver to find `example.com`.  
   - If the IP is in cache and TTL hasn’t expired → return immediately.

2. **Recursive Resolver (ISP or public DNS)**  
   - If not cached, the query goes to a **recursive resolver** (like 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8).  
   - This resolver can ask other servers and caches answers for future use.

3. **Root Servers (.)**  
   - If the resolver doesn’t know the answer, it asks a **root server**.  
   - Root servers don’t have the domain IP; they point to the correct **TLD server** (e.g., `.com`).

4. **TLD Servers (Top-Level Domain)**  
   - The resolver asks the TLD server which **authoritative server** handles `example.com`.  

5. **Authoritative Nameserver**  
   - The authoritative server responds with the actual IP address for the domain.  

6. **Return and Cache**  
   - The resolver returns the IP to your device.  
   - Both the resolver and your OS cache it to make future requests faster.

> 💡 **In short:** Browser → Resolver → Root → TLD → Authoritative → Browser.  
> DNS caches responses at multiple points to speed up repeat lookups.

## 🧠 Simplified Example (walkthrough)

Resolve `www.wikipedia.org`:

1. Browser asks local resolver (e.g., `1.1.1.1`).  
2. Resolver checks cache → miss.  
3. Resolver queries a root server → referral to `.org` TLD.  
4. Resolver queries `.org` TLD → referral to Wikimedia authoritative server.  
5. Resolver queries Wikimedia authoritative server → receives `208.80.154.224`.  
6. Resolver returns `208.80.154.224` to the browser; result cached for TTL seconds.

## 📄 Summary

DNS (Domain Name System) is the **Internet’s phonebook**. It converts human-friendly domain names like `google.com` into IP addresses so devices can communicate without memorizing numbers.

**How it works in short:** Browser → Recursive Resolver → Root → TLD → Authoritative Server → Browser. Results are cached along the way to speed up future queries.

**Moral:** Without DNS, you would have to remember countless IP addresses just to browse the web. DNS makes the Internet human-friendly and navigable! 🌐📱
